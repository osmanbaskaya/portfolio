- color palette
- research articles should not have huge gap (at the end)
- refactoring the repetitions (so many...)

done:
- navbar links sometimes do not work. most likely bigger Link span required. 
- what I am leanring nowadays -- chips should be in the center
- osman baskaya should have a link to home page.
- accordion columns - 3vs2
- better about part on top
- contact missing
- better footer (too thin and colors are off)
